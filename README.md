Travel Journal Web Application (Full SDLC Project)

A full-stack Travel Journal web application designed and built end-to-end following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The app allows users to discover destinations, filter by categories (e.g., beaches), and save personal travel journals with full CRUD functionality.
The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clean UI structure, responsive design, and dynamic screen manipulation. The backend uses Node.js and Express with PostgreSQL for data persistence, implementing RESTful APIs, authentication-ready architecture, and proper data modeling.
The project follows MVC principles, modular folder structure, and clean separation of concerns. It includes unit tests, integration tests, and basic end-to-end testing to ensure reliability and maintainability. The application is fully Dockerized, packaged as a Docker image, and deployed using a CI/CD pipeline, demonstrating real-world deployment practices.

This project showcases proficiency in:

- Full SDLC (planning, design, development, testing, deployment)
- Backend API development with Node.js & Express
- Database design and optimization with PostgreSQL
- Frontend UI/UX implementation and DOM manipulation
- Testing strategies (unit, integration, E2E)
- Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and production deployment
